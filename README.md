# Exercise_Entry

This is a data entry application using Python's Tkinter.

The application is set up to organize exercises you might be planning on performing during a workout.

You can enter each exercise you are thinking of performing and then save them into a local location for organization.

If so desired you can enter multiple exercises and then use the random function to allow the application to randomly choose an exercise for you to perform that day.
